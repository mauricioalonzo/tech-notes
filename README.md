### Dependencies

Some code snippets may require additional libraries. Make sure to check the individual files for any specific requirements.

## Usage

This repository is designed for easy navigation. Each topic is organized into its own folder. You can find notes, code snippets, and examples that illustrate key concepts. 

### Example Usage

To use a code snippet, simply open the corresponding file in your preferred text editor or IDE. For instance, if you are interested in a specific algorithm, navigate to the `algorithms` folder and open the relevant file. You can then copy the code and run it in your local environment.

### Code Snippet Example

Here‚Äôs a quick example of a simple Python function that calculates the factorial of a number:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```
